# Welcome to Blockstock! 

Blockstock is an online marketplace for 3D Minecraft models where you can find high-quality models for your projects. 
We have recently opened up our platform for outside vendors, giving them access to our GitHub repository so they can get an insight into upcoming features and log any issues they are experiencing. 

Whether you are a seasoned veteran in the industry or a novice just starting out, Blockstock has something for everyone. Our catalogue of 3D models offers over 1400 assets from artists and studios around the world to make your projects shine. With new monthly content added, you’ll always be able to find something unique and creative while building your project.  

The Blockstock GitHub page gives you access to our roadmap of updates as well as providing an opportunity to give us feedback on features we are working on. You can also report any issues that may arise during use of our products so that we can take quick action against them. This helps us ensure the highest level of quality control when it comes to using Blockstock products.
